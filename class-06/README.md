<a id="top"></a>
## Lecture 6

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 6 of Code 201, students will:
- Be able to translate a real-world problem domain into a code model by using provided user stories and technical requirements, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how the browser represents an HTML document as an object that can be manipulated with JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically render array data as an unordered list in the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how object literals are structured in JavaScript, as well as how to access and reassign values/functionality to their properties and methods, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how dot notation and bracket notation are used to access/reassign properties and methods in JavaScript objects, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.

### Survey Results

- I found TAs and instructor during the lab hours very helpful and also the 'Partner Power Hour'.  Potluck was great.
- I can't rave enough about Adriana! She's been so great!
- good week, I enjoyed the code challenges.  
- I liked the Lab 05 where the challenges were started and we had to problem solve through it. 
- Code challenges were also fun to learn new/different approaches to solving problems.
- I like how the class is willing to help everyone and we all get along well.  TA's are really helpful too!!
- The stack learning process and the TA's.
- I like Ray! He has been very helpful every time I bring up a problem to him. He gives me time to process and helps my find the solution on my own. 
- The TA's are AMAZING!!!!! and doing the potluck was a REALLY good idea! Should do that more often! 
- TA's are outstanding!



- One thing I noticed about the recordings regarding Visual Studio Code's background color on 'frontrowview' is that when the background is BLACK, it is little harder to read the code and follow with instructor. 
- Thursdays code challenge was not helpful at the time but it became helpful for me on Saturday. 
- It is kind of confusing what the expectations are for Monday nights. It seems like if you are not going to a meetup, there is not much to do on campus. 
- It would be nice to get more specif comments/feedback from TA's when they evaluate our assignments in Canvas. 
- Last Monday was kind of a waste of time because we didn't have class.
