# Class 2: Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

### Announcements:
 - Quizzes:
 	- Note that there will be some quiz content from time to time that we may not have covered yet (for instance, something on the quiz published today that we will not cover until the next class).
 	- Keep in mind that you have unlimited re-takes on the quizzes, and also that the quizzes are designed to be treated like they are open-book. It's more about what you can figure out than what you have memorized.
	- Also, note that the quizzes have two main purposes:
      1. To get you to re-engage with the content in a different way, reinforcing your knowledge.
      2. To help you prepare for the Code 301 entrance exam, which you will take at the end of Week 3. There is a minimum threshold you must pass on that exam (80%), and also, that exam factors into your grade in this class.

- **Lab 05c** will be published at the end of class. It is a tutorial on working with CSS selectors, and will be due at the time the other Lab 05 assignments are due. It is being published early to give you flexibility and extra time to complete these tutorials.

- Learning journals: Starting today, there is a daily Learning Journal assignment in Canvas. The purpose of this assignment is to reflect on what you have learned today. These assignments are due before the following class.

- There will be lots of detail work today on JS and CSS. We're going forward with the expectation that you will need minimal instruction on HTML except for concepts and overview of practices, and the specifics of how to interface with JS and CSS.


### Weekly Feedback

- Feedback Results
    - Describe your last week:
      - Since I did not take 101/102, I did not know if I was signing up for the right class especially having a full time day job.  After attending the first whole day, I am positive now that I made a good decision.  Little worried about the time management since having a day job, but I should be okay.
      - so far its been pretty good, just a lot to take in.
      - Simple review, covered 102 course information and formalities. 
      - Pre work took a lot of time but I think that working on it consistently last week helped me get back into "school mode".
      - Everything went well, I'm just learning how to navigate through Canvas.
    - Least Helpful
      - One thing, we had technical issues on "recording" for the first day. I am hoping not to have issues like this in the future since these resources will be valuable for us.
      - Still a little lost on the whole ACP.
      - Maybe push more people to do 102 before 201 as a lot of people in course were having computer set up issues. 
      - hard to think of anything since I've only been there for 1 day. There are too many new things and it is hard to keep up. 

    - Most Helpful
      - I also like "Partner Power Hour", it will give us the real world/first hand experience from people who are currently on the industry and also getting to know people and their industries. 
      - Being able to code along with instructor. 
      - tutorials
      - Learning through problem solving.
      - I found that taking 102 was extremely helpful in setting me up for the first day of this course. 
      - It was helpful to have a lecture and lab on the same day. Having an instructor, 2 TA's is great! Both Ray and Adriana were very approachable and helpful! I'm sure I am going to use these resources to the limit! Also it was great to chat with the other students in 301 and hear about their experience so far. 

    - Other
      - Everyone is really awesome (I know, only one class in) I can't wait to work with you all.
      - I'm new here and I am not sure if this is part of 102 or even if it is in the prework stuff and i missed it, but it would be nice to have a 1 page cheat sheet that lists all the tools needed for this class with a brief description of what it is.
      - It would be nice to have a page with information about nearby parking garages and/or public transportation from/to different locations.

### Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 2 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of the fundamental structures of HTML, including `<DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, and `<script>`, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of assorted data types such as booleans, strings, integers, in JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of and make use of introductory CSS concepts and techniques from Chapter 10 of the textbook, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Be able to successfully manage a code project in the command line by doing pushes and pulls to/from a repository on GitHub.

### Git command basics:

- `git status`
   - Provides a detailed description of current state in working directory

- `git add <file/s>`
   - Move one or more files from your working directory into staged status

- `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
   - Snapshot the staged changes in current working directory, with a brief message describing the changes

- `git push <destination> <branch>`
   - Push local commits to GitHub
## Live code

In our code demo today we'll do the following:

- Create a GitHub repo for our weekly project and `git clone` it
- Read through the lab assignment, translate it into a to-do list, and fulfill some technical components such as:
  1. Create a basic scaffold for a code project
  2. Utilize `if/else` statements to handle conditional logic
  3. Add in some basic input validation
  4. Utilize good Git processes including **a-c-p** cycles
