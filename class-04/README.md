### Feedback Survey

Good:

- Looks like "Recording Issue" is fixed which is great. THANK YOU, because some of the Lecture, I want to go back and watch.
- I’m so grateful for Adriana, she’s been so amazing and honestly would’ve been lost without all her assistance.
- TA’s for this course rock!
- It was an interesting  transition into stacked learning
- Roger and TAs help me think through my problems and I am usually able to figure out the solution instead of just giving me the easy answer.
- TA's when it comes to labs.
- Ray and Adriana are also great.

Not so Good:

- There was a lot of information thrown at us. Still trying to process it all.
- Paired learning seemed a little drawn out/basic.
- Monday-Thursday were good. Saturday was a ruff day for me. I struggled with executing what we learned in lecture to code. I understand the concept and what we are trying to do but I was having issues with writing that in code.  
- In order to grasp a better understanding of for loops and while loops, I think we should have spent just a little more time on the topic initially.

## Lecture 4

### Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 4 of Code 201, students will:

- Demonstrate understanding of how functions work in JavaScript, as well as the component pieces including declarations, calls, parameters, arguments, and returns, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Demonstrate understanding of CSS layout principles including block, inline, normal, relative, absolute, float, and fixed, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas
- Be able to successfully pair program with a fellow student and manage the collaborative and version control aspects of working with Git (from the command line) and GitHub (in the browser), as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.

### PAIR PROGRAMMING

Here's the basics of what you need to know about *pair programming*. This is a methodology for work in software development that is increasingly more popular and widespread (not only in development work, but also in interview processes), and we place a high value on training our students to pair program effectively. There's more details in the lab assignment.

- In pair programming there are two developers working on a single body of code on a single computer.
- One member of the pair is the Driver, and this person will be the one doing all of the actual typing work on the laptop. The Driver will be working on the Navigator's code by way of forking and cloning the Navigator's repository.
- The other member of the pair is the Navigator, and this person will work with only their voice and their thoughts.
- The Navigator does not touch the keyboard, nor does the Navigator work on their laptop "on the side". The Navigator is fully engaged with the work that the pair is doing, typically using a piece of scratch paper to sketch diagrams, take notes, or list ideas. At most the Navigator uses their laptop to perhaps keep a copy of this assignment document open or to look up something needed to write the code, such as a reference page like MDN.
- Under no circumstances does the Navigator work on any code on their laptop: for the pair programming process to be effective, both parties must be fully engaged on the code they're working on together.
- The lab time should be divided into two sections of approximately two hours each. At the halfway mark, you should swap roles and work on the other person's code. Remember to watch the clock and determine the best point to swap roles.
- In the case of an odd number of students, one group will have three members and they should rotate through three roles: Driver, Navigator, Observer. Each student should take on each role one time. They will need to be even more mindful about watching the clock to ensure that equal time is devoted to all three roles.
