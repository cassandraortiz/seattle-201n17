# Readings

Below is a collection of resources which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

**For your assignment, go through these resources, and create a markdown file titled `class-04.md` in your reading notes repo that summarizes the topics. Then ACP your master branch to create a rendered web page on github pages**

## Read

Here are the chapters to read before Class 4:

- Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)

*Note: This layout chapter is BIG. Focus your attention on understanding the core concepts presented on pp.358-364, and look at the code samples on [the website that accompanies the textbook](http://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-15). You will have another reading assignment on this chapter, so do not try to digest it all now.*
